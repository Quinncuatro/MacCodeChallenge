# MacCodeChallenge
My buddy made the mistake of saying "I haven't bought myFirstName.com yet." This is the code challenge I made so he can earn it back.

Challenge 1: If you're stuck on code, always check the source.

Challenge 2: Leave out the punctuation, and the quote cred.

Challenge 3: This one's just easy. Get the hint.
