# MacCodeChallenge
My buddy made the mistake of saying "I haven't bought myFirstName.com yet." This is the code challenge I made so he can earn it back.

Challenge 1: If you're stuck on code, always check the source.

Challenge 2: Leave out the punctuation, and the quote cred.

Challenge 3: This one's just easy. Get the hint.

Edit: I moved this off of it's own Digital Ocean droplet to an all purpose "here are my projects droplet." The file structure isn't the same, but the code is all there. The link above ^^ should drop you into the file structure.
